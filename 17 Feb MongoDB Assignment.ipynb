    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB** is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for nested data structures and dynamic schemas. MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and supports various features such as high availability, automatic sharding, and horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database management systems that do not follow the traditional tabular structure of relational databases. Instead, they use flexible data models that can accommodate diverse data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. NoSQL databases offer advantages such as horizontal scalability, flexible schemas, and high performance, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and accommodating dynamic and evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for flexible and dynamic schemas, making it well-suited for scenarios where data structures are subject to frequent changes or where the schema is not fully known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unstructured Data**: MongoDB excels at storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, JSON data, logs, and sensor data. It provides efficient storage and retrieval of such data without the need for complex joins or normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing it to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large-scale deployments with ease. It supports automatic sharding, which enables seamless scaling as data volumes grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Performance**: MongoDB offers high-performance read and write operations, especially for workloads involving complex queries, aggregation, and real-time analytics. Its native support for indexing and efficient storage mechanisms contribute to its performance advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Agile Development**: MongoDB's agile development approach aligns well with modern development practices, such as Agile and DevOps. It allows for rapid prototyping, iterative development, and faster time-to-market by eliminating the need for rigid schemas and complex data migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use Cases Requiring Geospatial Indexing**: MongoDB provides built-in support for geospatial indexing and queries, making it suitable for location-based applications, mapping, and geospatial analytics."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database that offers various features to meet the needs of modern applications. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexible Schema Design**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB employs a flexible schema design, allowing documents within a collection to have varying structures. This schema-less approach enables easy handling of polymorphic data and facilitates agile development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document-Oriented Storage**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB stores data in a document-oriented format called BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary representation of JSON documents. Each document can contain nested data structures and arrays, providing a natural way to represent complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High Availability**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports replica sets, which are self-healing clusters of MongoDB nodes. Replica sets provide automatic failover and data redundancy, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in the event of node failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Horizontal Scalability**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB's architecture allows for horizontal scaling across multiple servers through sharding. Sharding distributes data across shards (partitions) based on a shard key, enabling linear scalability and efficient distribution of workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Indexing**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single-field, compound, multi-key, text, and geospatial indexes. Indexes improve query performance by allowing fast retrieval of data based on indexed fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Aggregation Framework**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework for performing data aggregation operations such as grouping, filtering, sorting, and computing aggregate functions (e.g., sum, average, count) on documents within a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Ad Hoc Queries**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing developers to perform complex queries on documents using a rich query language similar to SQL. Queries can include conditions, projections, sorting, and various operators for querying nested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Geospatial Indexing and Queries**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB offers built-in support for geospatial indexing and queries, enabling storage and retrieval of location-based data. Geospatial queries allow for proximity searches, polygon queries, and other spatial operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Text Search**:\n",
    "   - MongoDB includes full-text search capabilities through text indexes, enabling efficient searching of text data within documents. Text indexes support language-specific stemming, stop words, and case-insensitive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Security**:\n",
    "    - MongoDB provides robust security features such as authentication, authorization, encryption (at rest and in transit), auditing, and role-based access control (RBAC). These features help protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with security standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Transactions**:\n",
    "    - Starting from MongoDB 4.0, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing developers to perform atomic operations across multiple documents within a single transaction. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity in complex operations involving multiple writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Scalable Storage Engine**:\n",
    "    - MongoDB's storage engine architecture allows for pluggable storage engines, such as WiredTiger and In-Memory, to accommodate diverse workload requirements. Each storage engine provides different trade-offs in terms of performance, durability, and compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a versatile and powerful NoSQL database solution suitable for a wide range of use cases, including web applications, content management systems, IoT (Internet of Things), real-time analytics, and more."

    "2. **delete_many() Method**:\n",
    "   - The `delete_many()` method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter condition from a collection.\n",
    "   - It removes all documents that match the filter criteria and continues until all matching documents are deleted.\n",
    "   - This method is suitable for bulk deletion of documents based on a common condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **drop() Method**:\n",
    "   - The `drop()` method is used to drop (delete) an entire collection from the database.\n",
    "   - It removes the entire collection along with all its documents and indexes.\n",
    "   - This method is typically used when you want to permanently remove a collection and its data from the database.\n",
